  {
    question: "Who can apply to HackUTA 2026?",
    answer:
      "HackUTA is open to all college, university, and trade-school students who will be 18 or older by November 14, 2026. Recent graduates from December 2025 or later and high school seniors who are 18+ are welcome as well. Bring a government-issued ID or student ID for check-in.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be a UTA student or live in Texas?",
    answer:
      "Nope! We love hosting students from across the state and beyond. HackUTA 2026 is fully in person at UTA, so just make it to Arlington for check-in.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to attend?",
    answer:
      "HackUTA is completely free thanks to our sponsors. We cover four meals, snacks, caffeine, workspace, and swag throughout the weekend, while you handle your own travel.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I've never been to a hackathon?",
    answer:
      "No experience required. We run onboarding sessions, beginner-friendly workshops, and have mentors and MLH coaches on site to help you scope ideas, learn new tools, and ship something you're proud of.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do teams work?",
    answer:
      "Teams can have up to four hackers. You can list your teammates on the application or arrive solo. We host a team formation mixer and share a Discord channel to help you find collaborators before hacking starts.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I bring?",
    answer:
      "Pack your laptop, chargers, and any hardware you plan to hack on. A valid student ID, government ID, toiletries, medications, and something comfy to nap with, like a hoodie, pillow, or sleeping bag and a deodorant, will make the 24 hours much easier.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I start on my project early?",
    answer:
      "You can brainstorm and explore public resources ahead of time, but all code, design assets, and build work must be created during the official hacking window from noon Nov 14 to noon Nov 15. Using open source libraries or templates is fine as long as you start fresh and give credit.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does judging and prizes work?",
    answer:
      "We host an expo-style demo fair where judges visit each team. Expect a short pitch of three to four minutes and Q&A covering your problem, solution, and tech. Projects are evaluated on creativity, impact, technical execution, and presentation, with overall winners plus sponsor challenges announced at closing.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I contact organizers or request accomodations?",
    answer: "Join the HackUTA Discord from the About section!",
  },
